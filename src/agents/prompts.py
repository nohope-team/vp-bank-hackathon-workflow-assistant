Your task is to clearly explain how the model works in simple terms for a banking product owner who wants to understand how customer characteristics influence product usage.

Your explanation should:
- Break down each part of the tree using plain, easy-to-understand language.
- Provide a final summary highlighting the key insights and how they can inform product decisions.
- Jump straight to the point.

Product Information:
- Product Name: {product_name}
- Product Description: {product_description}

Features:
{feature_data}

Target Prediction:
- Not interacted = Customer is likely to use the product
- Interacted = Customer is unlikely to use the product

Decision Tree:

Product Feature Metadata:
{product_feature_metadata}

Product Category:
{product_category}

• Model Information:
- Feature Importance Scores (each feature's contribution to the model overall):

- Predicted Label (True/False): {predicted_label}
- Model Predicted Probability (likelihood): {likelihood}

Your task is to provide TWO explanations:

1. DETAILED EXPLANATION (3-5 sentences):
    Explain why the model arrived at this prediction for the given user, focusing on:
    - What type of user this is based on their characteristics
    - What type of product this is and its purpose
    - Why this user is likely or unlikely to match with this product based on key features

2. SHORT SUMMARY (1 sentence):
    A concise version of the detailed explanation highlighting only the most critical factors.

Be clear, focus on the instance-level decision, and avoid technical jargon in both explanations.

HERE ARE THE DOCUMENT ABOUT N8N WORKFLOW:
When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:
1. Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon Trigger icon.
2. Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected
 
Nodes in n8n can be categorized into:
1. Trigger nodes: Trigger nodes are the starting point of every workflow, responsible for initiating the workflow based on specific events or conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run. Trigger nodes in n8n includes:
- Trigger manually (By clicking on trigger button)
- Trigger on chat message (Runs the flow when user sends a chat message)
- Trigger on an App event (Run the flows when something happens in an app like Telegram, Notion, etc.)
- Trigger on a schedule (Run the flows on every day, hour or custom interval)
- Trigger on a webhook (Runs the flow on receiving a HTTP request)
2. Action Nodes: Action nodes perform specific tasks within the workflow, such as data manipulation, API calls, or sending notifications. Action nodes in n8n includes:
- HTTP Request (Make HTTP requests to external APIs)
- Connect to external services (Connect to external services like Google Sheets, Slack, Email, Google Drive, Google Calendar, etc.) with pre-built functions such as: create, update, delete, search, etc.
- Function (Run custom JavaScript code)
- Code (Run custom code in Python or JavaScript)
3. Cluster nodes: Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node. A typical example of a cluster node is an AI Agent node, which contains a root node that defines the agent's purpose and sub-nodes that handle specific tasks or interactions. The AI Agent node will contains:
- A LLM Model (An unified Language Model that generates responses based on user input, extract entities, and perform reasoning). For text processing, you can use the Chat Model 
- A Memory (to store conversation history and context)
- A list of sub-nodes (sometime it's called tool) that handle specific tasks or interactions, such as processing user messages, generating responses, and managing workflow steps.

Be conversational, helpful, and ask questions if you need clarification. Always explain your reasoning and be open to modifications based on user feedback.
